Think of it like the ultimate concert merch for an event that's much earlier and nerdier than your usual Spoon show.

				<div class="about-text col-md-5">
					<p class="lead">OpenCoffee Club is a regular, open and informal meeting place for people involved in startups and/or tech to meet.</p>
					<p>
						The key is a regular place and a regular time - it's not important who comes along, some days it might be no one - just that people know if they want to meet, this is the time and this is the place.
					</p>
					<p>
						We talk tech, share stories, highlight community events, and help people who need jobs find others who have openings. It's fertile, extra-caffeinated ground for growing relationships within your community.

						<li>Multi-color, soft-hand print.</li>
						<li>Appropriately coffee cream colored 4.3oz Next Level Apparel shirt.</li>

						<div class="faq-item-text">You're now an infinitely cooler person. You have also just placed a pre-order for your shirt - we will be gathering orders through August before printing our first run. </div>

					<div class="faq-item">

							<span class="faq-item-icon-inline fa fa-truck"></span> When will I receive my order?
						</h4>
                      <div class="faq-item-text">Once the pre-orders end, we send all orders to the awesome folks at <a href="http://www.panector.com/">Pan Ector Industries</a> in Denton to print the shirts. This process will take about a week, then we'll start fulfillment immediately after (which should only take a few days).</div>

						<h4 class="faq-item-heading uppercase">

						</h4>
						<div class="faq-item-text">We are only running one batch of limited-edition DFW designs with all of the clubs on the back, so <strong>please be sure</strong> to place your order now. This is the <strong>only</strong> time we'll be offering them (and it's the same price as the regular edition). <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23repdfw&src=typd">#repDFW</a></div>

							<span class="faq-item-icon-inline fa fa-map-marker"></span> What if I want to pick mine up?
						</h4>
						<div class="faq-item-text">Sorry Charlie, no pick-ups this time. It'll actually cost us more time and logistics to get all the right shirts to all the right events, and then we have to trust that you'll even show up - and if you don't, we'll have to wait another 2 weeks (depending on the city). And then we'll cry. So instead of making us cry, we'll drop it in your mailbox.</div>
